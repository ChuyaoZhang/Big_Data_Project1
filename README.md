# Big_Data_Project1
My project includes two parts, program(test.py) and report(Project1 Report.doc)
The program is the code which can finish all the task in the project.
It can predict the winner of a LoL game by some features of the game. 
The attached picture(DT_figure.png) is one of the outputs in my program.
The report will introduce the process of the project and the implementation of the program.
